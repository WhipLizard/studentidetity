# Student Profile Blockchain System

## Vision
The vision of the Student Profile Blockchain System is to create a secure, decentralized, and transparent platform where students can manage and verify their academic credentials and personal information. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform aims to provide an immutable, easily accessible, and tamper-proof repository for student records, enabling students to share their verified profiles and documents with educational institutions, employers, and other stakeholders, while maintaining full control over their data privacy.

## Flowchart
Below is a simplified flowchart of how the system works:

1. **Student Registration**: 
   - Students register on the platform by providing their name, college name, roll number, email, and student ID. 
   - A unique profile link is generated and stored on the blockchain.

2. **Document Upload**:
   - Registered students can upload important documents (e.g., marksheets) to the platform.
   - Each document is stored with a secure passcode and is linked to the student's profile.

3. **Document Access**:
   - Students can share their profile link or document access passcode with others.
   - When someone tries to access a document, they must provide the correct passcode, which is verified on the blockchain.

4. **Profile Verification**:
   - Anyone with a student's profile link can view the publicly available information to verify the studentâ€™s identity.

```plaintext
[Start] --> [Register Student] --> [Generate Profile Link] --> [Upload Documents] --> [Secure with Passcode] --> [Share Profile/Passcode] --> [Verify Identity] --> [End]
```

## Smart Contract Address
The smart contract for the Student Profile Blockchain System is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract address is:

`0x941bAaE6F73b5952E6C3AA39Ed83acbD60C23059`
![27 08 2024_22 31 28_REC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df933829-3ece-4fe5-9977-15d0997198d9)


This address allows interaction with the deployed smart contract for functions like registration, document upload, and profile access.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with Educational Institutions**: Partner with universities and colleges to automatically generate and verify student credentials.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Expand the system to be compatible with multiple blockchains, ensuring wider accessibility and integration.
- **Enhanced Privacy Features**: Implement advanced cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs to further enhance the privacy of student documents.
- **Mobile Application**: Develop a mobile application that allows students to manage their profiles and documents directly from their smartphones.
- **NFT-based Credentials**: Issue NFT-based diplomas and certificates that are easily verifiable and transferable.
